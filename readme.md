# About

This is a fork of the [Image Resizer for Windows](https://imageresizer.codeplex.com/) project by Brice Lambson.

To build, you'll need the [WiX Toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/) installed.

From the original author:
> Image Resizer for Windows is a utility that lets you resize one or more selected image files directly from 
> Windows Explorer by right-clicking. I created it so that modern Windows users could regain the joy they left 
> behind with Microsoft's Image Resizer Powertoy for Windows XP.
